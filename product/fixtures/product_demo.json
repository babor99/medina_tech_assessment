The OLED Tru-Finder EVF is another ╬▒6000 expert-level tool, with real-time data for planning and previewing shots.\nExposure Control compensates for bright/dim scenes, Focus Zoom enlarges a chosen detail and Display Mode reveals histograms and more.

            "full_desc": "Sony ALPHA A6100 24.MP Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Lens\n\nCapture special moments and portraits to remember and share. Thanks to stunning image quality and speed based on technology developed for our full-frame models, you can leave the hard work to the camera. The ╬▒6100 ensures you'll never miss an instant. Keeping active subjects in constant, steady focus is absolutely vital to capturing every important moment, whether you're covering a sporting event or documenting everyday life. Sony's sophisticated AI-based subject-tracking algorithms won't let you down, processing massive volumes of spatial data at high speed and in real time. Real-time Eye AF provides continuous eye tracking when shooting portraits in motion. You can prioritize either the left or the right eye, and it works even when the face is partially hidden, backlit or facing downwards. Sony's innovative eye-detection algorithms have been adapted to animal as well as human, to give you sharply focused pet portraits and beautiful wildlife shots. The camera's wide AF coverage is based on dense arrays of 425 phase-detection points and 425 contrast-detection points, for greatly increased detection accuracy. Fast performance from the latest-generation processing engine helps achieve a remarkable 0.02-second AF acquisition speed, while advanced algorithms work to predict your subject's future location. Impressively speedy internal processing and the high-capacity buffer memory mean you can fire off continuous shots at up to 11fps with after-view or 8fps for real-time preview, with minimal display lag. You can take around 77 shots in JPEG (Standard) format in one continuous burst. Silent shooting is helpful in situations where noise would be distracting, such as at live performances or when taking animal portraits. The ╬▒6100 can shoot continuously without shutter noise at up to 8fps with AF/AE tracking, even in AF-C mode, and with Real-time Eye AF or with Real-time Tracking. The APS-C sensor uses copper wiring for better conductivity and enhanced circuit processing to help optimise light-collection efficiency. In conjunction with the latest-generation image processing engine, this enables better image resolution and natural-looking textures. Improved noise suppression produces cleaner images in dark settings where high-sensitivity shooting is required. The native ISO sensitivity reaches a maximum ISO 32000, with expanded ISO sensitivity up to ISO 51200 for stills. Noise reduction is particularly effective in the frequently used medium-to-high sensitivity range. The skin tone feature inherited from our latest, highly acclaimed full-frame cameras captures the natural beauty of human skin tones, helping you take portraits that look their best. Natural-looking images with improved colour reproduction better match what you see in real life, with more vibrant colours of flowers and similar objects as well as suppression of jaggies and false colours. Fast Hybrid AF brings high speed, accuracy and tracking performance to meet the stringent autofocus demands of 4K movies. More effective use of the focal plane phase-detection system enables more stable AF, while the contrast-detection AF system contributes to overall accuracy. Smooth, steady focus is maintained even when an object crosses in front of your subject.",

            "full_desc": "Acer Swift SF314-42 AMD Ryzen 5 4500U 14\" Full HD Laptop with Genuine Windows 10\nAcer has given the SF314-42, like its predecessor, a stylish and slim metal case. The chassis has a matte silver finish, which Acer has contrasted with a black plastic display frame. Acer has used smooth surfaces throughout. There is no maintenance hatch though, so accessing the machine's internal components requires some disassembly. We shall discuss this in the Maintenance section of this review. The processing of our review unit does not give rise to any criticisms. Gaps between materials are precise, and nothing protrudes in any way. The device also does not reveal any serious stability problems. The base unit can be twisted a bit, but not concerningly so. The same applies to the lid. Applying pressure on the back of the lid does not cause the display to distort at all. The display is held in place by pleasingly tight hinges. These hold the lid firmly in place, with the display barely teetering as we use it. The hinges allow the display to be opened up to 180┬░, for reference. It is possible to open the lid with one hand, too. The laptop has two USB Type-A ports, with one opUSB 2.0 standard and the other on the newer USB 3.2 Gen1 standard. There is also a USB Type-C port that utilizes the latest USB 3.2 Gen2 standard. The latter supports both DisplayPort and USB Power Delivery (PD), meaning that the device can output audio and video while being charged. Acer has still included a full-sized HDMI port and a power connector though, giving the Swift 3 two charging and video outputs. The laptop does not have a memory card reader. Acer has equipped the Swift 3 with an Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX200, a modem that not only supports the 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, but also the newer ax standard. Additionally, the AX200 offers Bluetooth 5.0 functionality. Our table below represents optimal Wi-Fi conditions with no other Wi-Fi devices placed between our review unit and our router. We positioned the laptop and our router closely, too. Acer has also equipped the Swift 3 with a 720p webcam. The results are somewhat washed-out and lacking in color accuracy. With a Delta E deviation of just under 12, the Swift 3 misses our ideal target of 3 by a wide margin.",
